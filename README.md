Please consider that you have chosen a folder and set the filename for autosaving. After you have checked autosave, the software will save the complete file you are editing  everytime within seconds to the desired file. The time is determined in the autosave textbox. By default, the autosave is not checked and is set to 5 secs.

The "Exit" button will end the session immediately and will not ask for permission. :)

There are many things to do.

I hope it will help.

Thanks
